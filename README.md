contains two interface  components. The Zoomable Text Field; formally 
known as the [Mondo Text Field][1], and Mondo Switch.

Usage
-----

 1. Compile in Xcode.
 2. Double click CocoaMondoKit.ibplugin to load the plugin into 
Interface Builder. (Notez Bien: Interface builder will reference 
the file instead of copying it.  Keep the .ibplugin file in a 
location it won't be deleted.)
 3. In the Xcode project you want to use the plugin:
     -  Right click the Linked Frameworks folder and click **Add -> Existing Frameworks**.  
     -  Select the CocoaMondoKit.framework directory.
     -  Right click your target and click 
**Add -> New Build Phase -> New Copy Files Build Phase**.  For destination, 
select Frameworks, leave the path field blank, and close the window.
     -  Drag the CocoaMondoKit framework from Linked Frameworks to the Copy 
Files build phase you just added.

To reference CocoaMondoKit objects in your kode, simply import the main header file.

    #import <CocoaMondoKit/CocoaMondoKit.h>

Many thanks to Brandon Walkin for releasing [BWToolkit][2] as open source.  
At times poking at the BWToolkit source code was much more useful than 
official [Interface Builder plugin documentation][3].
